# advent-of-code
I enjoy coding challanges, I wish to some day complete the 2021 and 2022 advent of code.<br>
If I do so, I'll post it here.
### For now, I've done:
2022:<br>
- Day 1 in Python, Rust
- Day 2 in Python
- Day 3 in Python
- Day 4 in Python

<br><br>
2021:<br>
- Day 1 in Go, C++
- Day 2 in Go, C++
- Day 3 in Go
